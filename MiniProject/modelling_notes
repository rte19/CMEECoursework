Ordinar Least Squares: OLS

Is ordinary, because the x axis variale is error free, with the y axis variable being relatively error prone.
If we use allometrically related data, then x and y variables have about the same error proneness, so x is error prone, you need to use other methods.


Non Linear Least Squares: NLLS

1) You choose initial values for parameter of beta 
2) Then, computer refines the estimations of the beta values
3) Whether a refinement has taken place in any step of the iteration is determined by re-calculating the residuals at that step
4) Eventually, if it all goes well, we find a combination of betas that are very close to the desired solution

use nlsLM() in R, from minpack.lm

So the general procedure is:
1 Start with an initial value for each parameter in the model
2 Generate the curve defined by the initial values
3 Calculate the residual sum-of-squares (rss)
4 Adjust the parameters to make the curve come closer to the data points. This the tricky part — more on this in the next slide
5 Adjust the parameters again so that the curve comes even closer to the points (rss decreases)
6 Repeat 4–5
7 Stop simulations when the adjustments make virtually no difference to the rss

Once the algorithm as converged (hopefully – but you may be surprised how well it usually works), you need to get the goodness of fit measures
First, of course, examine the fits visually
Also, report the best-fit results, including:
    Sums of deviations of the data points from the final model fit (final
    RSS)
    R^2
    Estimated coefficients
    For each coefficient, standard error (can be used for CI’s), t-statistic and corresponding (two-sided) p-value
The function summary.nls will give you all these measures
Remember, the precise parameter values you obtain will depend in part on the initial values chosen and the convergence criteria
You may also want to compare multiple models

NLLS-regression has all the assumptions of OLS-regression:
    No (in practice, minimal) measurement error in explanatory variable (x-axis variable)
    Data have constant normal variance — errors in the y-axis are homogeneously distributed over the x-axis range
    The measurement/observation error distribution is Gaussian — for example, what would the error distribution of this non-linear model be: y i = β 0 e β 2 x i + ε i
    
    What if the errors are not normal? — use Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods instead.
