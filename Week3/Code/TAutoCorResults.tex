\section{Results}
The autocorrelation of the orginal KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature data was calculated to be r = 0.326, p-value = $3*10^{-4}$.
\\ Therefore, due to the p-value being so small, 0.0003, there is a less than 0.03\% probability that the results were due to chance. This means it can be assumed with confidence that their is an autocorrelation exhibited of 0.326. However, this correlation coefficient is fairly mild, and so there is only a weak positive relationship observed.
