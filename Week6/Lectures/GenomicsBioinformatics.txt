Genotypes vs haplotypes
    When we talk about genotypes we don't care which chromosome e.g ID1 a/g
    When we talk aout haplotypes we do care about the chromosome numbers e.g ID1.1 a ID1.2 g 

We use di-allelic models a lot beecause it is rare that there will be more than two
    alleles, more tha two different nucleotides at the sam position

If we assume a di-allelic model, then two alleles, we can have 3 genotypes
    However, if we have 4 alleles, all 4 bases at the same position, then we have 10 genotypes
    - this makes is mathematically MUCH harder

Heterozygosity:
    The proportion of heterozygous individuals
    in the population
    Equation, see slides
Homozygosity:
    The proportion of homozygotes
    Equation, see slides

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) is reliable if the following assupmtions are met:
    Random mating: individuals mate with each other without regard to genotype
    Males and females have equal allele frequency
    Di-allelic locus

Deviations from HWE:
    Assortative mating: not random with respect to genotype
        Positive assortative - individuals with same genotype more likely to mate
        Negative assortative mating
    Inbreeding: mating of related individuals
    Population structure: sample of individuals from two or more subpopulations
    Natural selection



##Genetic Drift - 05/11/19 - main.pdf

*The fa in the Expected allele frequency equation should be a fA*

*fa(t) = 0, means the allele is lost. = 1 means it is fixed*

The founder effect can cause speciation, like polar bears from brown bears, cool stuff.

**If delta > 0, then HT > HS**

If FST > 0.7 or 0.8 then you could start thinking you have two different species,
    not just two different populations.

The higher the migration rate, the lower the FST
However, you need a very large miration rate to effect FST if the population size is huge.
You only need a small migraton rate to mke a difference if N is small.
N = population size.
